# Wireshark_Packet_Analysis_Toolkit


Introduction
----------------------------------------------------
Welcome back, everyone! I am excited to share this network analysis project using the Wireshark Packet Analysis Toolkit. This project helps showcase practical applications of the Wireshark network protocol analyzer. It involves capturing packets across various protocols (HTTPS, DNS, FTP, etc.) and conducting detailed analyses to identify potential threats and optimize network performance. The repository includes sample .pcap files, comprehensive reports, and a user-friendly guide, making it an excellent resource for network troubleshooting and cybersecurity insights.
